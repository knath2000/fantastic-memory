## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
df<-read.csv('/Users/kalyannath/Desktop/Projects/PremierLeague/stats.csv')
df
```

```{r}
perseason<-c()
seasons<-unique(df$Season)

for (season in seasons){
  tempdf<-filter(df, df$Season == season)
  awarded<-sum(tempdf$Awarded)
  perseason<-c(perseason, awarded)
}

names(perseason) <- seasons
values<-data.frame(Season=seasons, PenaltiesAwarded=perseason)

ggplot(data=values, aes(x=Season, y=PenaltiesAwarded, group=1)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle("Number of Penalties Awarded per Season from 12-13 to 21-22 Seasons")
```
```{r}
print("Here we can clearly see")
