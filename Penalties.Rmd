## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#First let's read in the data from the attached csv file. It contains how many penalties a team scored, was awarded, missed, and its conversion rate. The data is grouped by season starting from 12-13 and ending in the 21-22 season
df<-read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knath2000/fantastic-memory/main/stats.csv')
head(df)
```

```{r}
#Vector to hold total penalties awarded per season
perseason<-c()

#Vector holding all season labels
seasons<-unique(df$Season)

#Creating a temp dataframe with rows grouped by season. Then calculate the total number of penalties awarded per season add that to the perseason vector
for (season in seasons){
  tempdf<-filter(df, df$Season == season)
  awarded<-sum(tempdf$Awarded)
  perseason<-c(perseason, awarded)
}

#Assign names to the calculated values for organizational purposes
names(perseason) <- seasons
#Turn the perseason vector into a DataFrame for use in ggplot later
values<-data.frame(Season=seasons, PenaltiesAwarded=perseason)

#Create a ggplot line plot with points highlighting the data
ggplot(data=values, aes(x=Season, y=PenaltiesAwarded, group=1)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = "19-20", color = "red")+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Number of Penalties Awarded per Season Before and After \n the Introduction of VAR", 
       subtitle= "Data gathered from Transfermarket.us",
       caption = "The red line indicates when VAR was introduced in the Premier League")+
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "italic"), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0.0))
